He virtually created the detective story and perfected the psychological thriller. He also produced some of the most influential literary criticism of his time.</p>

            <p> important theoretical statements on poetry and the short story and has had a worldwide influence on literature.He was born as Edgar Poe in Boston, Massachusetts; his parents died when he was young. Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan, of Richmond, Virginia, but they never formally adopted him. After spending a short period at the University of Virginia and briefly attempting a military career, Poe parted ways with the Allans. Poe's publishing career began humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827), credited only to "a Bostonian".</p></div>
